//TODO
// move the abstractions of a spline editor containing some number of points here.
// this should handle various functionality such as dragging the points to move them,
// ensuring the resulting spline is a function/reordering points to maintain that property,
// clicking the spline on an empty segment to add a new point, right-clicking points to remove them,
// and so on. for use in the response curve editor, keyframes in the automation editor, and
// potentially the palette editor.
